## Release Note
* v0.0.1 finally make it just work.I packed it up for more platform user in Release. You can just go and [download](https://github.com/arthurkiller/electronic-QQ/releases) it.

## Note
 This project is because I used to work on Linux and the author of electronic-WeChat said he will never write a wechat in nodejs because he just don't use QQ !!!.So I with my friend wanna to do this based on the electronic-wechat code.

 I have scheduled TODO list in 2017, hope can make more progress to get a more beautiful UI for more Linux QQ user to enjoy and easy use.

 If you have any idea about this just email me , let's do it together!
