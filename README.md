## Note
 I really toooo busy these days and get stuck on AngularJS. I am a back-end progremar with C/C++/Go and never write any JS before....LOL

 I have scheduled this issue in 2017 TODO list 

 This project is because I used to work on Linux and the author of electronic-WeChat said he will never write a wechat in nodejs because he just don't use QQ !!!.So I with my friend wanna to do this based on the electronic-wechat code.

 If you have any idea about this just email me , let's do it together!
